<!--
**dojje/dojje** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on** optimizing synergies across cross-functional verticals. (Also, trying to figure out how to microwave fish without becoming that person.)
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** yet another JavaScript framework that promises to “finally fix” the problems created by the last five frameworks I learned.
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on** projects that involve minimal effort, maximum credit. Ideally something that looks good on a whiteboard.
- 🤔 **I’m looking for help with** Understanding why my code works, even though it really shouldn’t. Also, Kubernetes. Always Kubernetes.
- 💬 **Ask me about** the brilliance of using the default Github template
- 📫 **How to reach me:**
    - Carrier Pidgeons: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500, USA (Addressed to the cave inside the bushes)
    - Email: dojje07@gmail.com
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** Once wrote a script to automate a task that took 5 minutes and the script took 3 days. Productivity achieved!
